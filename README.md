### About
Limotours is a car rental service, where you can rent the most luxury limousines including a chauffeur, who gives you an unforgettable tour through your city.
We are located in Berlin, Hamburg and Dresden and each city contains an unique tour.
Our tours are perfect for various events of all kinds, for example memorable birthday partys, bachelor partys or even weddings.

### Products
We have created 3 different tours: one in Berlin, one in Dresden and one in Hamburg. <br/>
But you can also rent our limousines for individual tours, where you can decide on your own, where the tour starts and ends. 
This can be especially used for weddings or transfer trips, for example.
