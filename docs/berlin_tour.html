    <div>
        <p>Your chauffeur will pick you up at the central train station. From there, you will drive to some of the beautiful attractions Berlin has to offer and where all eyes will be directed towards you.</p>
        <p>At first, our tour will lead to Checkpoint Charlie. From there we will drive past the Victory Column and trough the most luxury street of Berlin – the Kurfürstendamm. Now our tour will lead you through Tempelhof and Kreuzberg, right over the Potsdamer Platz to the Brandenburg gate. This will also be our photo stop, where you will be able to take some amazing pictures.</p>
        <p>Now our tour goes on, past the Reichstag and through the Berlin district of Gesundbrunnen, where you can also see the Memorial of the Berlin Wall. Further, you will drive through Prenzlauer Berg and finally past the Alexanderplatz to the Berlin Television Tower. From there you will also see the Red Town Hall on the other site. Our tour continues to the Berliner Dom and also past the Humboldt-University.</p>
        <p>From there we will drive you through the Museum Island and again over the Spree to one of the biggest clubs of Berlin – the Soda Club. This will be our end station, where your chauffeur will drop you. This club has 5 different floors and is a perfect way to turn the night into day!</p>
